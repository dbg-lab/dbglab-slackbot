‚Äú You‚Äôre an engineer building this codebase.
You've been given @ARCHITECTURE.md @README.md and @TASKS.md .
- Read all carefully. There should be no ambiguity about what we‚Äôre building.
- Follow @TASKS.md and complete one task at a time.
- After each task, stop. I‚Äôll test it. If it works, commit to GitHub and move to the next. "

Coding Instructions

- Write the absolute minimum code required
- No sweeping changes
- No unrelated edits - focus on just the task you're on
- Make code precise, modular, testable
- Don‚Äôt break existing functionality
- If I need to do anything (e.g. Supabase/AWS config), tell me clearly

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Let me understand what I need to do:

1. I'm building a Slack chatbot with OpenAI integration
2. I need to read the architecture, README, and tasks documents carefully
3. I need to follow the TASKS.md and complete one task at a time
4. I should write minimal code, be precise, modular, and testable
5. After each task, I should stop and let the user test it

Let me start by reading the TASKS.md file to understand what the first task is.

From TASKS.md, I can see the implementation plan is broken down into phases:

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation

### Task 1.1: Create Project Structure
**Goal**: Set up the basic directory structure and empty files
**Test**: Verify all directories and files exist as specified in ARCHITECTURE.md
**Files to create**:
- `app/__init__.py` (empty)
- `app/handlers/__init__.py` (empty)
- `app/handlers/slack_handler.py` (empty)
- `app/services/__init__.py` (empty)
- `app/services/openai_service.py` (empty)
- `app/services/slack_service.py` (empty)
- `app/utils/__init__.py` (empty)
- `app/utils/config.py` (empty)
- `main.py` (empty)

This is Task 1.1 - creating the basic project structure with empty files.

Let me check the current project structure first to see what already exists.</details></think>

I'll help you build this Slack chatbot step by step. Let me start by understanding the current project structure and then begin with Task 1.1.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great, I can see that the project currently only has the documentation files (ARCHITECTURE.md, README.md, TASKS.md) and a .specstory directory. 

Now I need to start with Task 1.1 from TASKS.md:

### Task 1.1: Create Project Structure
**Goal**: Set up the basic directory structure and empty files
**Test**: Verify all directories and files exist as specified in ARCHITECTURE.md
**Files to create**:
- `app/__init__.py` (empty)
- `app/handlers/__init__.py` (empty)
- `app/handlers/slack_handler.py` (empty)
- `app/services/__init__.py` (empty)
- `app/services/openai_service.py` (empty)
- `app/services/slack_service.py` (empty)
- `app/utils/__init__.py` (empty)
- `app/utils/config.py` (empty)
- `main.py` (empty)

I need to create all these files as empty files to establish the basic project structure. Let me create them all in parallel.</details></think>

Now I'll start with **Task 1.1: Create Project Structure**. I need to create the basic directory structure and empty files as specified in the ARCHITECTURE.md.
